It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4Q2W6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Jigsaw Puzzle .","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23919.13510798887384079.02ce72ed-705e-4a69-99e4-ec4409026791.68ecfa04-d756-4b04-a063-89f055b7fbad","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61468.13510798887384079.29620cd1-30af-48ee-954c-31f7bae51ee9.ce16f770-22a8-4baf-8879-5b1722c646a3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["6317TinyGames.573931FF2DC74_agdqmtxhayfww"],"ContentIds":["af031dda-24b4-7ce8-7d44-ebd95a1cf880","38d8a937-6d4f-722f-e501-58514f0cebe7","4ec762d6-93f1-459c-759f-31577943fe50"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Jigsaw Puzzle contain 12 categories and 300 pictures.

On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over series of many games, somewhat like poker. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent.

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King.\r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Each of the foundation piles must start with an ace and end with a king.\r\n♣ The cards from the 7 columns can be placed in descending order by alternating between red (hearts and diamonds) and black (spades and clubs). For example, you can place a 5 of hearts on a 6 of spades. \r\n♣ You are allowed to move runs of cards between columns. A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n♣ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n♣ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the level. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n♣ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible. Important cards might be buried under other cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n♥♥ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too.

Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more French decks of 52 cards.\r\nThe player is dealt an initial two card hand with the option of drawing cards to bring the total value to 21 or less without exceeding it, so that the dealer will lose by having a lesser hand than the player or by exceeding 21. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards yet to be dealt, and adapt their wager and playing strategy accordingly. While in our implementation we do not teach counting, we do offer basic strategy hints to train you on how to improve your odds.\r\nMany rule variations of BlackJack exist. Our implementation offers most common casino rules:\r\n- Play with 4 decks\r\n- Decks are reshuffled when there is less than 20 cards left.\r\n- Dealer stands on soft 17\r\n- Player can split twice\r\n- Neither surrender nor insurance are offered\r\nWhen hints are enabled, player would need to confirm his choice if it's not the most optimum action.\r\nWhen you running short on credits, feel free to use our build in slot machine - truly the loosest slots in town!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDV2QC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Time Mysteries: Inheritance","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11505.9007199266754320.0cb3422b-a2f2-4715-9b28-a0873b21b338.046e41ab-8a3e-4e19-8aad-b34c2b8cd01b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"198","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.TimeMysteriesInheritance_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["c955c190-2a20-eadd-1739-12765b79c0e6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nTime Mysteries: Inheritance – Remastered is an enhanced version of one of the most important games in Artifex Mundi’s portfolio and the first chapter of an exciting trilogy of time travel games from 2010.

This game comes from Ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nGoal:\r\n\r\nMove all the cards to the Foundation (upper right). When the 'Easy' option is on, you only have to move all the cards on the table (tableau or pyramid) to win.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\nYou can move cards to the Foundation by Double-Tap or dropping a card on another, exposed, card. If the ranks combine to 13, both cards will move to the Foundation. Kings, being rank 13, move to the Foundation immediately upon being touched.\r\n\r\nIf you like to relax with solitaire or puzzle games then we think you'll love Pyramid Solitaire*.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to remove pairs of cards that add up to the total of the highest card in the deck from an arrangement of cards - a pyramid of 28 cards.\r\n\r\nWhen using the common French deck, Jacks value at 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13. So the highest value is 13. In the numbered Spanish deck the highest numbers are also the Kings at 12, so the pairs must add up to 12.\r\n\r\nTo set up the pyramid, deal one card face up at the top of the playing area, then two cards beneath and partially covering it, then three beneath them, and so on till you have dealt out a row of seven cards for a total of 28 cards dealt. Refer to image.\r\n\r\nThe remaining cards are placed to the side face down. This is the Stock.\r\n\r\nTo play, pairs of exposed cards can be removed to the Foundation if their values total 13 (12 if using the Spanish deck). Thus, kings can be removed immediately to the Foundation. Cards must not be covered. Thus when an Ace rests on a Queen, that Queen can not be removed.\r\n\r\nYou may draw cards from the Stock one at a time and match it with any exposed card. if no match is made the drawn Stock card is still discarded into the Foundation.\r\n\r\nOnce the Stock is exhausted and/or no more pairs can be made, the game ends.\r\n\r\nTo score, count the number of remaining face up cards in the pyramid. A perfect score is therefore zero, where all cards have been matched into the Foundation.\r\n\r\nConditions for winning\r\n\r\nTo be considered won, all cards (cards from the pyramid and cards from the stock) must be moved to the foundation; the game cannot be won if at least two cards cannot be moved from the stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations\r\n\r\n-Relaxed Pyramid Solitaire: to be considered won, all cards from the pyramid must be moved to the foundation; the game can still be won with cards left in the stock.\r\n-Redeals may or may not be allowed.\r\nThree cards at a time from the stack, repeating until no matches can be made; placing all -cards totalling 13 in a stack.\r\n-Alternatively, seven cards are dealt below the pyramid. These cards can match each other exposed cards in the pyramid or from the stack.\r\n-Another addition is playing Pyramid Solitaire with a cell, filled either from the tableau or from the waste upcard.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n+ addictive gameplay\r\n+ enchanting graphics set in Ancient Egypt\r\n+ simple controls, easy to learn\r\n+ atmospheric sound effects\r\n+ a well made free solitaire game!\r\n+ Unlimited Undo \r\n+ Detailed Statistics","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4NSDL","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Military Jeep Parking Driving Simulation 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61962.13510798887473021.4844109e-75e5-4b20-953c-46e2d9e9368e.a5152e93-8745-4ee8-8e92-da52038fbef8","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12548.13510798887473021.61f15742-ecdf-4799-bb95-e7691bb1c8b4.a350bc9c-b5fc-4599-93ef-6deea3da5e4e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25378.13510798887473021.1bcfed50-2d32-47c3-8829-60e0f83393bb.a68b129d-6585-42d7-b82e-0895bf8e4baf","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["31252IrfanShafi.MilitaryJeepParkingDrivingSimulati_m164m09tj2s82"],"ContentIds":["0d92f4b1-8be6-1406-8334-4cc4eb57ff4d","da24726f-a476-c8b3-eab9-8f4e2b42b6a9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Military Jeep Parking driving Simulation is a realistic parking game for army soldiers.

The deeper you dig, the more rewards you get. Digger Machine is an arcade game where you dig for precious minerals, diamonds, gold... Before achieving your goal, you can build bases which will make your machine better and stronger!\r\n\r\nBeware though, as the path to fortune is filled with traps! And when you finally make it to the bottom, the \"Boss\" will wait for you there!\r\nTherefore, download now and start to extract precious minerals, the most valuable of which is - Awesomite.\r\n\r\nOnce Grandpa Pecos decided to share a secret with his grandson — there's a hidden treasure buried somewhere on the former mine. But there's one problem. The treasure lies very deep underground at a depth of more than 250 yards! Then the grandson thought about his friend, crazy miner named the Mad Digger. He's the only one to get things done.\r\n\r\nIdle Miner Simulator - Gold & Money Clicker is a simulation game mixes with clicker game and idle clicker. You are in the role of a mining tycoon, build your mining system, farm gold and invest into other resources in order to gain profit.\r\n\r\nIdle Miner Simulator - Gold & Money Clicker is also a strategy game but the player doesn’t have to fight the enemies. The point of the game is to strategically building and optimize mining to receive most profit.\r\n\r\nThe strategy of the game include: touch the screen to process the gold mining. Earn money, upgrade your gadget, hire new manager. After that, build new mine of your own and upgrade them further and finally become a tycoon.\r\n\r\nYour task is to dig deeper and deeper and collect gems until you find and mine the treasure. It's not as simple as it seems. The oxygen runs out with every descent, you need to extract minerals to improve your equipment and tools as well as to buy grenades and dynamite to make the descent faster.\r\n\r\nEquipment description:\r\n— Drill bit: Crushing obstacles and detonate lava block.\r\n\r\n— Engine: Providing acceleration and steering force for rig.\r\n\r\n— Laser: Melting obstacles.\r\n\r\n— Freezer: For cooling, avoiding drill overheating and burning.\r\n\r\nWe need collect gold to create new equipment.\r\n\r\nDrill bit, engine and laser will generate heat. The drilling machine will blow up when the heat is too high.

When you destroy a line of 4 you receive 100 points for each jewel in the line.\r\n✓\tWhen you switch on a row buster or column buster the base score for each jewel is 60 points.\r\n✓\tWhen you explode a super jewel the base score for each jewel is 100 points.\r\n✓\tWhen you explode a jewel bomb the base score is 40 points.\r\n✓\tIf you blast multiple special jewels, you will get additional points for each and every jewel.\r\n✓\tIn order to pass to the next level and win the current round, you need to acquire a certain number of points before the time runs out. The levels get progressively harder as you play on.\r\n✓\tThe final score and the score at the end of each level is calculated by giving a 10000 points bonus for each completed level plus the score obtained at the current level.\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Whilst simple in concept a good deal of strategy is required to complete the layouts.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to remove all the tiles from a layout in the least possible time. Layouts can vary in pattern, size and shape. Tiles are removed in pairs and may only be removed if they are both free and match one another. Free tiles are ones that have no other piece touching the left, right or both sides and no tiles on top.\r\n\r\nWhilst all deals generated by Mahjongg are solvable you will need to remove pairs of tiles carefully to ensure you don’t stop the removal of remaining pairs. \r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

NEW: AI Robot \"Pablo\" will walk you through the basics. \r\n\r\nTeleport around, explore the arena, have a conversation, or do a silly dance together. Once you are ready, join into the arena for a casual game. Simply guess what someone else is drawing or draw something for others to guess. \r\n\r\nFeeling energy for action? Try our multiplayer MR Paintball, splatter your friends or the arena with lovely colors. Remember to dodge and refill!\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Paint_Arena and share videos or screenshots of your best 3D paintings or MR paintball games with hashtag #Paint_Arena :)\r\n\r\nConceptualization: \r\nMany virtual reality games today are designed to enhance graphic intensity and immersion, but increasingly isolate the players. We believe Windows Mixed Reality can be much more than that. We decided to design a casual game that people of all ages can play, share, and socialize in mixed reality. We were inspired by a classic interactive puzzle game for friends and family, while we were amazed by the potential of the mixed reality motion controllers, so Paint Arena was born. Many thanks to Mixed Reality Academy for the paint brush example.  \r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\nYou will need a HoloLens or a WMR immersive headset with a mixed reality motion controllers (and headphones, if not Samsung Odyssey) to enjoy this experience.\r\n\r\nThis social experience is best enjoyed in a casual standing pose. If you feel you are not at the right height after app launch, simply stand up, look forward, and say or tap \"Reset Floor Level\". \r\n\r\nYou could draw and talk to others and guess each others' drawings. If you are the first one to join, you would be assigned the drawer for the first round. You would be given a random word. Draw something to help others guess the word (without drawing any letters or digits). Once someone guesses your word correctly, a guesser will chosen at random to become the drawer. \r\n\r\nToggle \"Painting On\" to \"Paint Balling\" to start shooting paintballs and splatter the arena. Each full tank contains 100 paintballs. Every 5 seconds, you can partially refill the tank with 20 paintballs by pressing \"Refill 20 Paintballs\" button or saying the voice command \"Refill Paint Ball\". Try to move around to dodge incoming paintballs, or teleport to reposition. Score by reducing others' health bars to zero, upon which they would enter ghost mode and respawn at a random location in 10 seconds. \r\n\r\nIn Immersive headsets: Make sure you set up boundary for all experiences before you begin. While \"Painting On\", once you see your robotic right hand holding a paint brush, you can press the right hand trigger button to start drawing. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your right hand controller, and press right hand trigger to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nOnce you see your robotic left arm holding a motion controller, you can use the touch pad to select paint color. Alternatively, you can tap \"Pick Color\" to bring up the large color wheel. \r\n\r\nIf you made a mistake, you can say \"Erase Last Stroke\" or press right hand controller grab button. You can also clear all strokes by saying \"Erase All Strokes\". \r\n\r\nTo rotate your view, point the joysticks left or right on one of the motion controllers. \r\n\r\nTo teleport, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then point your cursor at the floor with one of the motion controllers, and hold the joystick forward until a Teleport marker appears, then release the joystick. \r\n\r\nIn HoloLens, you can use gaze, tap gesture to select options on the menu in front of you (look below chest level). You can use the same voice commands as elaborated above. While \"Painting On\", you can reach your hand out in front of you, pinch and hold while dragging the paint brush along. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your gaze and air tap to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nBefore teleporting in HoloLens, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then you can use your gaze to aim, and then tap to dash across the map! You could also hide the Guessing Window and the Panel if they are blocking your gazes.

Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field. Launch the ball and then use the pedals very effectively to keep the ball in play for as long as possible. A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field, partially protected by player-controlled plastic bats called flippers. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times. \r\n\r\nPinball is addictive and quick hand to eye co-ordination essential. Pinball Mania 2017 brings the whole pinball experience to life in the palm of your hand. Flashing lights and bouncing atmospheric soundtracks keep your eyes firmly fixed on the ball, and your fingers burning the buttons. \r\n\r\nPinball Mania 2017 is a stimulating brain game.
